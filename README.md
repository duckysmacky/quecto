# quecto
yet another minimal text editor
made with c and ncurses
very much wip

# build
`> git clone https://github.com/shroomwastaken/quecto.git`
`> cd quecto`
`> make`
should theoretically work on both windows and linux

# todo
- make tabs work
- scrolling
- line numbers
- minimal commands (ctrl + x = something)
- organize the code
