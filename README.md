# quecto
yet another minimal text editor

made with c and ncurses

very much wip

# build
`> git clone https://github.com/shroomwastaken/quecto.git`

`> cd quecto`

`> make`

only works on linux for now

# todo
- make tabs work
- scrolling
- line numbers
- minimal commands (ctrl + x = something)
- organize the code
