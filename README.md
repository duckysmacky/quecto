# quecto
yet another minimal text editor

made with c and ncurses

very much wip

# build
`> git clone https://github.com/shroomwastaken/quecto.git`

`> cd quecto`

`> make`

works on both linux (out of the box)

and windows (assuming you have the mingw64 toolchain although others have not been tested and might work)

also windows for some readon has a weird flicker effect when rendering the buffer

# todo
- make tabs work
- scrolling
- line numbers
- minimal commands (ctrl + x = something)
- organize the code
- fix flicker on windows
